          <li>1 &#189; teaspoons salt</li>
          <li>1 (16 ounce) package linguine</li>
          <li>&#189; pound small shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
          <li>&#189; pound bay scallops</li>
          <li>&#189; pound mussels, cleaned and debearded</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Heat crushed garlic and 2 tablespoons oil in a large saucepan over medium heat until garlic starts to sizzle, 
            1 to 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes with juice, red pepper flakes, oregano, basil, and salt. 
            Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 
            about 11 minutes; drain and keep warm.</li>
          <li>While the linguine is cooking, heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. 
            Stir in shrimp and scallops and cook, stirring frequently, until shrimp turn pink, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
          <li>Stir shrimp, scallops, mussels, and parsley into tomato mixture; cook until sauce begins to bubble and mussels open, 
            about 7 minutes. Pour sauce over linguine and serve.</li>
        </ol>
